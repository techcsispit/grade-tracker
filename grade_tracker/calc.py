"""Calculation module for academic grades, GPA, and averages.

Numerical policy
----------------
1. Percentages are calculated at full precision.
2. Letter grades are determined from the *unrounded* percentage, never from
   a rounded display percentage.
3. Individual percentages are never rounded before being averaged into a
   subject average.
4. Intermediate weighted grade-point totals and credit totals are never
   rounded; only the final user-facing result is rounded, at the existing
   documented output precision (2 decimals for SGPA/CGPA/subject average,
   1 decimal for displayed percentages in the CLI/report).
5. Letter-grade thresholds (90/80/70/60) are unchanged.

Why Decimal is used for classification
--------------------------------------
Binary floating-point cannot represent most decimal fractions exactly.
Computing ``(score / max_score) * 100`` with ``float`` can land a hair
*below* a threshold even when the values are exactly at that threshold in
decimal (e.g. ``8.1 / 9`` is exactly 90%, but ``(8.1 / 9) * 100`` evaluates
to ``89.99999999999999``), misclassifying the grade. Constructing the
operands with ``Decimal(str(x))`` recovers the shortest round-trip decimal
text (which is what the CSV/CLI actually stored) and yields an exact decimal
percentage for classification. Aggregates (averages, GPAs) stay in ``float``
because their final 2-decimal rounding absorbs representation error
(verified against exact rational arithmetic), so converting the whole
module to ``Decimal`` would be unnecessary refactoring.

    A grade row records a result for one student, in one (semester), for one
    (subject) on one (date). score, max_score, and credits describe the
    result; they are NOT part of its identity, so a corrected score is still
    the same assessment. Two rows with the same
    (student_id, semester, subject, date) therefore describe the same
    academic record, and repeating one must not be counted twice.

    A subject repeated in a *different* semester yields a different key, so
    legitimate retakes are preserved.

    Returns None when the record is malformed, i.e. it has no (non-empty)
    subject and therefore no determinate identity. Callers must then treat
    the record as un-deduplicatable rather than invent an identity for it.
